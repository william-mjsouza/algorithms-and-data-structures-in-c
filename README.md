# Algorithms and Data Structures in C
This repository contains my implementations of various algorithms and data structures in the C programming language.

## Organization
- `algorithms/`: Implementations of common algorithms such as sorting and searching.
- `data_structures/`: Examples of data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- `tests/`: Test cases to verify the correctness of the implementations.

## How to Compile
To compile any program, use the following command:
```bash
gcc -o output_file source_file.c
